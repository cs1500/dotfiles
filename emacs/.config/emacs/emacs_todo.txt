To do for emacs:
	- auctex customisation
    	- smooth scrolling is kind of bad rn
        - remove auctex and force 4 spaces for indentation
	- viper customisation (top priority)
    	- "u" should be able to undo more than once!
    	- caw keystroke implementation
    	y- visual mode cannot exit with v
        	y- mass indentation support
            y- mass yank, delete, and paste
        y- keystroke >> currently does not do 4 spaces as tab...
        - dir + viper: always stay on the file-to-open
    - editor
    	- latex thing, no auto indent to two when in environments, or autoindent
        always to 4 spaces
    	- terminal integration
        - split buffer behavior, opening stuff on left buffer should
          remain on that buffer...
    	- (very long) startup page with recent directories
        - closing a buffer should go back to the homepage always,
          or perhaps the current project!!
    	- backspace on tabbed should still just delete the entire tab
        - nicer ruler @ 80 characters per line
	- firejail emacs by default
